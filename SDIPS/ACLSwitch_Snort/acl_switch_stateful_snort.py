# Author: Jarrod N. Bakker
# Part of an NWEN402 project at Victoria University of Wellington
# during 2015.
#
# This is an edited version of ACLSwitch that has configured to operate
# alongside Snort. Snort alerts are sent to ACLSwitch, these are then
# parsed and appropriate ACL entries are configured. Note that the
# following flows are supported:
#   - IPv4 ICMP
#   - IPv4 TCP
#   - IPv4 UDP
#   - IPv6 ICMPv6
#   - IPv6 TCP destination ports
# Only the above flows are supported as they can be tested easily using
# the Scapy and Paramiko Python modules.
#
# The comments from ACLSwitch can be found below.
#
# This implementation of ACLSwitch uses packet arrival time to enforce
# stateful firewall policies. The stateless implementation of ACLSwitch
# is extended to achieve this. Therefore a rule within the ACL
# considers source and destination IP addresses, the transport-layer
# protocol and source and destination ports. Different sets of rules
# can be distributed to switches uses policies. As a result, rich policies
# can be deployed on top of a network topology. A rule within the ACL
# indicates a flow of traffic that should be blocked at the switches.
#
# Because rules which block traffic are important to the security
# of a network, the priority of such rules should be higher than
# the rules which allow traffic to flow. Currently, the default
# priority value is used for rules which allow traffic and the max
# value is used for rules which block traffic. Later on it may be
# possible to specify custom priorities.
#
# The RESTful interface code has been adapted from
# http://osrg.github.io/ryu-book/en/html/rest_api.html.
#
# The original license for simple_switch_13.py can be found below.
