Description of Test Suites
==========================

Suite 1
    Only send traffic that will be blocked by the IPS. The first packet/s
    in each transmission should pass through, the remaining packets should
    fail. Packets failing to pass through mean that the IPS correctly
    identified and blocked the traffic at the switches.

Suite 2
   Only send traffic that won't be blocked by the IPS. Packets failing to
   pass through mean that the IPS incorrectly identified and blocked the
   traffic at the switches.
