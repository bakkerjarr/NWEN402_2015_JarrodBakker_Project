#
# Test: Description of the test's purpose here with other details.
#       This template contains a variety of functions to perform
#       certain tasks, such as: send an ICMP echo request to a
#       particular host or send a TCP header with the SYN flag set to
#       a particular host on a given port.
#
# Usage: python test_name.py <number of hosts in the network>
#
# Test success: All traffic receives some form of response (dependent 
#               on protocol).
# Test failure: At least one flow does not received an answer.
#
# Note:
#   - Test output can be found in test_name.py_results.log
#
#   - Scapy is used for packet manipulation.
#
#   - The script assumes that the hosts are part of the 10.0.0.0/24
#     subnet.
